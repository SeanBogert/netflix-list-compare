# Netflix List Compare

# What is this for?
Is your significant other as indecisive as mine?  Does it take far too long to actually find something you both want to watch?  This chrome browser extension was created to help speed things along.  Netflix users are able to add movies/tv shows to their "My List" section as a way to save them off to watch later.  This extension will compare two profiles lists and return back all of the titles that match, allowing you both to have a much more condensed list to choose from.
